    <p>There are many things in life that can make her happy. She considers herself relatively down to earth, though.</p>
    <p>What makes her happiest are the simple pleasures, such as a latte on a slow morning, a walk in the sunshine, a picnic with a cute boy smiling at her from across the 6 foot invisible partition.</p>

    <p>She loves reading books, even though she struggled with it early on in elementary school. Reading was an escape in the air-conditioned library during recess, and it became her favorite pastime growing up. She looked forward to every summer- summer reading programs were the highlight. She received a free paperback, and coupons for a free pizza for doing what she would be doing anyways. It felt a little bit like a scam because she enjoyed it so much.</p><p>Now, during quarantine, she finds solace in reading once again, mostly from Reese's stellar reccommendations.</p>

    <p>Sarah discovered her deep love of sundresses in Hawaii, where she bought two sundresses at two different boutiques. They became regulars in her daily wardrobe rotation (warmish weather permitted), replacing much-disliked thigh constrictors, or jean shorts.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, she wears one to feel pretty, put less effort into her outfit (how hard is one piece of clothing?) and boost her confidence. Who could deny her this? Certainly not herself.</p>

    <p>She loves food, especially from Trader Joe's. She's had the privilege to visit both Ecuador and Israel and sample their respective cuisines. Hummus will never be the same, and Amor milk-flavored wafers are deeply missed.</p>
